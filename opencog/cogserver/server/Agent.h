/** The MindAgent Class
 * This class defines the base abstract class that should be extended by all
 * opencog agents.
 *
 * Typically, an opencog agent is coded similarly to a Java thread (except that
 * there's currently no concurrency between multiple agents): it has a "run"
 * method which is called by the server everytime the agent is selected for
 * execution. So, to write a custom agent, all one has to do is to derive from
 * the Agent class and implement the desired behavior inside the 'run' method.
 *
 * The Agent base class also provides the 'frequency' attribute which
 * defines how often the agent will be executed. A value of 1 (the default)
 * means that the agent will be executed every server cycle. A value of 2 means
 * that the agent will be executed every 2 cycles. And so on.
 *
 * Since agents are registered with the cogserver using the Registry+Factory
 * pattern, agent classes must override the 'classinfo' which uniquely
 * identifies its class. Typically the 'classinfo' method will simply forward to
 * a call to an 'info' class method that provides the actual class info -- the
 * 'info' class method is required by the Registry+Factory anyway.
 *
 * A typical derived Agent declaration & initialization would thus look as
 * follows:
 *
 * \code
 * // MyAgent.h
 * #include <opencog/cogserver/server/Agent.h>
 * #include <opencog/cogserver/server/Factory.h>
 * class CogServer;
 * class MyAgent : public opencog::Agent {
 *     virtual const ClassInfo& classinfo() const { return info(); }
 *     static const ClassInfo& info() {
 *         static const ClassInfo _ci("MyAgent");
 *         return _ci;
 *     }
 *
 *     void run(CogServer* server) {
 *         // implement the agent's behavior
 *         ...
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * // application/module code
 * #include "MyAgent.h"
 * #include <opencog/cogserver/server/Agent.h>
 * #include <opencog/cogserver/server/CogServer.h>
 * ...
 * Factory<MyAgent, Agent> factory;
 * CogServer& cogserver = static_cast<CogServer&>(server());
 * cogserver.registerAgent(MyAgent::info().id, &factory);
 * cogserver.createAgent(MyAgent::info().id, true);
 * \endcode
 *
 * @todo create a run wrapper around the actual implementation of the run method.
 * This would flip an "active" or "running" boolean property on or off. And
 * carry out other admin tasks before and after each cycle, without subclasses
 * needing to carry these out themselves unless they had specific reason to.
