;
; Sketch of an alternate imperative-processing architecture.
; The stuff here does not work.  However, it is meant to be
; a generalization or softening of the processing done in
; "imperative.scm".  It is meant to be more robust, more
; scalable, more human-like. Its incomplete, due to some
; design difficulties.
;
; Here's the idea:  The knowledge base consists of a collection
; of parsed sentences that Eva "knows" -- these are ground knowledge.
; Each of these parsed sentences are directly associated with specific
; (mechanical, physical) actions.  When Eva hears a new English-language
; sentence, she performs a fuzzy match, to see if it resembles any of
; the known ground-sentences.  The best fuzzy-match wins, and the
; highest-scoring associated action is performed.
;
; The above seems like a good idea; there is one design difficulty,
; though, preventing current progress.   During the fuzzy match, we
; need to fund specific modifiers (adjectives, direct objects,
; prepositions, etc.) and get values for them.  So, for example,
; in a sentence "look to the left", we have to be able to pick out the
; verb "look", and the direction "left", because these are the primary
; components for physical action.  Thus, if Eva hears "look to the sky",
; we want the fuzzy matcher to identify "to the sky" as the "direction".
; Currently, the fuzzy matcher does not have the ability to pick out
; components in this fashion. Its not clear how to build the fuzzy
; matcher that will do this,. because its not clear of what a good
; example looks like.
;
; The fuzzy matcher has other problems. During fuzzy matching, it would
; be nice to say that certan parts of a graph are highly invariant,
; and must be matched precisely, while others can be loose, and roughly
; matched. These are part of the scoring system. Its not clear how to
; associate the scores with the different parts of the pattern. Are they
; truth values?  Do we need the protoatoms for this?
;
; Fuzzy matching does give us some ability of maybe learn.  If Eva
; hears  "look up at the sky", and she knows "look up" as grounded
; knowledge, then "at the sky" can be isolated as a correlate of "up",
; and used as a possible synonym.
;
; Handling of synonyms is another problem that this proposed
; fuzzy-matching architecture does not seem to handle cleanly.
; part of matching requires considering synonymous words: e.g. "glance"
; as a synonym for "look", but also synonymous phrases: "take a gander
; at your left". In this example, a phrases is synonymous to a single
; word; more generally, different phrases are synonymous to each other.
; We want to do fuzzy matching, but with synonymy as an intermediate
; step.
;
; The above considerations have halted the progress here.  I'm keeping
; the code around for a little while, though, as a reminder of a
; possible direction to explore.
