Wikipedia parse management scripts
----------------------------------

The scripts here are used to automate the ingestion of wikipedia
articles.  These should be tailored to fit your needs.

A quick overview:

* run-all-servers.sh: the top-level shell script; opens multiple
  terminal sessions with tmux/byobu, and starts both opencog and
  the relex servers. Use F3 and F4 to switch to different terminals.

* wiki-ss-*.sh: the top-level parser script. It pulls wikipedia
  articles, one by one, from the data directory, and submits them
  for parsing and counting.  This script should be manually lanuched
  in the 'parse' byobu window.  Be sure to open the database in the
  cogserver, first. The data directory needs to be manually adjusted
  here, and also in the ss-one.sh script.

* ss-one.sh: the actual sentence-splitting workhorse. It handles
  each wikipedia article, moving the article to a different directory
  when finished with it.  Note that there are hard-coded paths in
  here, pointing to the sentence splitter.

* submit-one.pl: script to actually send sentences to the cogserver.

* opencog-*.conf: cogserver config file

* config-*.scm: another cogserver config file
